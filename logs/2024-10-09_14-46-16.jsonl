Reason step by step\nResponse: Here's the breakdown:\n\n**Assumption:** We're assuming the drying time is directly proportional to the number of shirts. This means if you double the shirts, you double the drying time.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Find the drying rate:** If 25 shirts dry in 1 hour, that means the drying rate is 25 shirts per hour.\n\n2. **Calculate the time for 30 shirts:**  To find out how long it takes to dry 30 shirts, divide the number of shirts (30) by the drying rate (25 shirts per hour):\n\n   30 shirts / 25 shirts/hour = 1.2 hours\n\n**Answer:** It will take approximately 1.2 hours to dry 30 shirts under the sun. \n",
